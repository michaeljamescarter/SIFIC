Immunology of Severe Febrile Illness in Children in the COVID-19 Era


Gene-set enrichment analysis was undertaken on previously published data from Jackson et al. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10312302/) that are available at ArrayExpress under accession E-MTAB-11671 and E-MTAB-12793. We used the R (version 4.4) implementation of gene-set enrichment analysis (fgsea, version 1.3) and the C7 immunologic signature gene sets available from as part of the Human MSigDB Collections (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/collections.jsp). We used KEGG enrichment analysis. We compared gene enrichment between children with MIS-C and healthy controls, with definite bacterial infection and healthy controls, definite viral infection and healthy controls and children with MIS-C and definite bacterial infection. Figures were drawn in ggplot2.
